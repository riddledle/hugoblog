I'm using [DeviceOne](http://www.deviceone.net/) to develop an APP recently, which i find easier than React native and convenient to debug on devices.

All the ui components in deviceone can be dragged and resized, each type of ui components also has its customized properties making it very quick to define a particular ui component.

I'm using deviceone to practice writing some native javascripts codes. All the basic functions of an APP can be supported by deviceone so i think it's a good start for me to get more familiar with native javascripts and all the ajax stuff.
